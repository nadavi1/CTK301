    <p> <a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank"> This is a link</a> War. War never changes. The Romans waged war to gather slaves and wealth. Spain built an empire from its lust for gold and territory. Hitler shaped a battered Germany into an economic superpower. But war never changes. In the 21st century, war was still waged over the resources that could be acquired. Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons: Petroleum and Uranium. For these resources, China would invade Alaska, the US would annex Canada, and the European Commonwealth would dissolve into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last remaining resources on Earth. In 2077, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise. A few were able to reach the relative safety of the large underground vaults.</p>
<p> <a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a>You're crying in the rain, paley. Maybe Khans kill people without looking them in the face, but I ain't a fink, dig? You've made your last delivery, kid. Sorry you got twisted up in this scene. From where you're kneeling it must seem like an 18-carat run of bad luck. But, truth is... the game was rigged from the start.</p>

    <p>I don't want to set the world on fire
        I just want to start
        A flame in your heart
        In my heart, I have but one desire
        And that one is you
        No other will do
        I've lost all ambition
        For worldly acclaim
        I just want to be the one you love
        And with your admission
        That you feel the same
        I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of
        Believe me
        I don't want to set the world on fire
        I just want to start
        A flame in your heart
        I don't want to set the world on fire, honey
        I love you too much
        I just want to start
        A great big flame
        Down in your heart
        You see
        Way down inside of me
        Darlin', I have only one desire
        And that one desire is you
        And I know
        Nobody else ain't gonna do
        I've lost all ambition
        For worldly acclaim
        I just want to be the one you love
        And with your admission
        That you feel the same
        I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of
        Believe me
        I don't want to set the world on fire
        I just want to start
        A flame in your heart</p>
