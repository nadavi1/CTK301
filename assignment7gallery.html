    <p><a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> I used to float, now I just fall down
        I used to know but I'm not sure now
        What I was made for
        What was I made for?
        Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
        Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
        Just something you paid for
        What was I made for?
        'Cause I, I
        I don't know how to feel
        But I wanna try
        I don't know how to feel
        But someday, I might
        Someday, I might
        When did it end? All the enjoyment
        I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
        It's not what he's made for
        What was I made for?
        'Cause I, 'cause I
        I don't know how to feel
        But I wanna try
        I don't know how to feel
        But someday I might
        Someday I might</p>

    <h2>Ken (h2)</h2>
    <img  class="img" src="Ken.jpg">
    <p><a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> Doesn't seem to matter what I do
        I'm always number two
        No one knows how hard I tried, oh-oh, I
        I have feelings that I can't explain
        Drivin' me insane
        All my life, been so polite
        But I'll sleep alone tonight
        'Cause I'm just Ken, anywhere else I'd be a ten
        Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blonde fragility?
        I'm just Ken
        Where I see love, she sees a friend
        What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?
        I wanna know what's like to love, to be the real thing
        Is it a crime? Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings?
        And is my moment finally here, or am I dreaming?
        I'm no dreamer
        Can you feel the Kenergy?
        Feels so real, my Kenergy
        Can you feel the Kenergy?
        Feels so real, my Kenergy</p>

    <p><a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> I'll take you for a ride
        On my garbage truck
        Oh, no
        I'll take you to the dump
        'Cause you're my queen
        Take you uptown
        I'll show you the sites
        You know you wanna ride
        On my garbage truck
        Truck, truck, truck
        We'll pass the mansions by
        Drive right through the needle's eye
        Oh, my
        My, my, my, my
        I got a stereo
        You just gotta turn the knob
        Well, maybe we'll go
        As far as we can
        I'll be your garbage man
        I'll take out your junk
        And I'll crush it down
        Jesus in the rearview
        And the highway patrol is up ahead
        In my garbage truck, truck
        I'll never throw you away
        When you're old and gray
        We'll just roll it away</p>
