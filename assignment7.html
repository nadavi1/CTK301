    <p> The Navigation link boxes are all the saem width regadless of the amount of text inside. Make hte nav link background change when you roll over them (even the link in the h1). The main header and navigation have gradients in the background. Clicking on the ISU image in the footer should open the ISU main site in a new window/tab. All three of your pages should have the same format for the headers, navigation, and footer. This paragraph is justified, the others are not.</p>

<p> <a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank"> This is a link</a> There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
    Then school comes along just to end it
    So the annual problem for our generation
    Is finding a good way to spend it
    
    Like maybe... Building a rocket Or fighting a mummy Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower Discovering something that doesn't exist Phineas: Hey! Or giving a monkey a shower Surfing tidal waves Creating nanobots Or locating Frankenstein's brain Phineas: It's over here! Finding a dodo bird Painting a continent Or driving our sister insane Candace: Phineas! As you can see There's a whole lot of stuff to do Before school starts this fall Phineas: Come on Perry! So stick with us 'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all! So stick with us 'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!</p>

    <p> <a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank">This is a link</a> Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
